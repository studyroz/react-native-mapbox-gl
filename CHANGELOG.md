## 7.2.0

- Upstream changes in Mapbox iOS SDK 5.6.0 has made installing the SDK as an embedded framework difficult. We have therefore discontinued supporting manual installations. To update, follow the iOS installation instructions using cocoapods.

## 7.0.0

### Breaking changes:

- iOS mapbox libraries updated to [5.5.0](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/releases/tag/ios-v5.3.2) android libraries updated to [8.2.1](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native/releases/tag/android-v8.2.1)
- `StyleSheet.create` removed.
  Mapbox styles are now just a map no need for `StyleSheet.create`.
  `StylesSheet.identity` also removed, use expressions array instead:

  ```jsx
  mapboxStyle=MapboxGL.Stylesheet.create({..., fillColor: MapboxGL.Stylesheet.identity('color') ...})
  ...
  <MapView
    ...
    <FillLayer style={mapboxStyle}... />
  </MapView>
  ```

  is now:

  ```jsx
  mapboxStyle={..., fillColor: ['get', 'color'] ...}
  ...
  <MapView
    ...
    <FillLayer style={mapboxStyle}... />
  </MapView>
  ```

  See [docs/StyleSheet.md](docs/StyleSheet.md) for more examples

- `isTelemetryEnabled` removed (as no longer supported on android) [#1](https://github.com/mfazekas/maps/pull/1)
- MapView#flyTo, MapView#bitBounds, MapView#flyTo, MapView#moveTo, MapView#zoomTo, MapView#setCamera moved to Camera. There is also experimantal properties, to replace those. See [docs/Camera.md](docs/Camera.md)
- Camera related properties on `MapView` now have to be specified on a camera object:

  ```jsx
  <MapView
     zoomLevel={8}
     centerCoordinate={[-111.8678, 40.2866]}
     ...
  >
     ...
  </MapView>
  ```

  is now:

  ```jsx
  <MapView
    ...
  >
    <Camera
       zoomLevel={8}
       centerCoordinate={[-111.8678, 40.2866]}
    />
  </MapView>
  ```

  See [docs/Camera.md](docs/Camera.md) for more examples

- User tracking properties moved from `MapView` to `Camera`

  ```jsx
  <MapView
     userTrackingMode={UserTrackingModes.Follow}
     ...
  >
     ...
  </MapView>
  ```

  is now:

  ```jsx
  <MapView
    ...
  >
    <Camera
       followUserLocation=true
       followUserMode="normal"
    />
  </MapView>
  ```

  The following properties were changed:

  - MapView#userTrackingMode is now Camera#followUserMode and Camera#followUserLocation
  - followUserMode is now a string with ('normal','compass','course'), and UserTrackingModes enum is deprecated
  - MapView#onUserTrackingModeChange is now Camera#onUserTrackingModeChange and payload contains followUserMode and followUserLocation.

- ShapeSource#images was depreacted, use Images#images instead.

  ```jsx
  <MapView
    ...
  >
    ...
    <Images images={{pin, dot}} />
    ...
    <ShapeSource ... >
       <SymbolLayer ...>
    </ShapeSource>
  </MapView>
  ```

- TODO document all changes
